A theoretical future version of the chatbot evolves to not only answer questions but also autonomously write new marketing campaigns, manage social media accounts, and design new digital products for the entire company. \n\n 3. A highly speculative scenario where the AI chatbot's capabilities expand to the point that it solves complex, unstructured global marketing challenges for all of Tolaram's brands, a task that would require decades for a team of human experts to accomplish.",

                  <strong>Also known as Weak AI</strong>, this is the only type of artificial intelligence that has been successfully realized to date. ANI systems are designed and trained to perform a single, specific task with a high degree of proficiency. They operate within a predefined, limited context and cannot perform functions outside of their designated domain.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                  <strong>Examples of ANI are ubiquitous:</strong> the AI that recommends movies on Netflix, the voice assistant on a smartphone, the system that detects fraudulent credit card transactions, and the software that powers self-driving cars are all forms of ANI.

                  <strong>Also known as Strong AI</strong>, this is the theoretical and aspirational goal of much AI research. AGI refers to a machine with the ability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence to solve any intellectual task that a human being can.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                  A key characteristic of AGI would be its ability to <strong>generalize knowledge and transfer skills</strong> from one domain to anotherâ€”for example, applying insights learned from studying medicine to solve a problem in finance.

                <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                  AGI would possess cognitive abilities, reasoning skills, and potentially self-awareness akin to a human's.
